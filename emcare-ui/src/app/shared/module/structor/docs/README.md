# Documentation

This is the source for documentation pages. Documentation pages are built by Gatzby, and presented by the Docz theme.

To add pages, just add files in the `docs/src/pages` folder. The pages will be deployed to https://helsenorge.github.io/structor as soon as the commit is merged innto master.

Note the formatting of files:

```
---
name: Test 1
route: /test1
menu: Resources
---
# Test 1
## Even more documentation
Type here the most beautiful lines about your code.
```
